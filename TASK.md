# Code Test

(All units in px)

- 1080x1080 circle (should crop overflowed content)
- 10 290x290 circles
  - 2 rows
  - Margins of 30 (first items should have 0 left margin and all bottom row items should have no bottom margin)
  - Centered vertically
  - Scrolls horizontally
  - Item number should be centered horizontally and vertically in each circle
  - Clicking a circle will hide the scrolling content and scale the 290x290 circle to 1080x1080 over 1 second
- Use vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (ES6)
- Self contained folder that will run when double clicking the HTML file (if you want to put all of the code in a single file, that’s fine too)

When you’re finished, zip it up and send it to scott@essential.com
